Additional Quotes by Haruki Murakami


First Quote: “Love can rebuild the world, they say, so everything's possible when it comes to love.”

Second Quote: “A certain type of perfection can only be realized through a limitless accumulation of the imperfect.” 
	
Third Quote: “As long as you have the courage to admit mistakes, things can be turned around.” 

Fourth Quote: “Why do people have to be this lonely? What's the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness?” 

Fifth Quote: “But who can say what's best? That's why you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people too much. My experience tells me that we get no more than two or three such chances in a life time, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of our lives.”
